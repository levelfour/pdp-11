# pdp-11
PDP-11 Simulator

## Compilation

This project uses ``opam``. Please install it first (usually you can get it from package manager).

```
opam switch 4.01.1
opam install omake extlib
```

After installation, you can run ``omake`` to build. Then ``pdp11`` will be generated.

## Usage

(Now developing...)

```
./pdp11 [a.out-pdp11 formatted binary]
```
